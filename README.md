2ND YEAR SEASONNNNNN

## Pre-midterm
- ADT List
- ADT Stack
- ADT Queue

## Intuition
- Master the fundamental operations of ADT and learn how to apply them to exam scenarios/problems. Exams often have problems that will require you to combine operations to perform various tasks e.g. creating a function that searches through a pre-existing list, finding certain elements that satisfies a condition, deleting those elements from the original list, and creating a new list populated with the deleted elements.

## Types of Data Structure Implementation
- Array
- Linked List
- Cursor-based

### ADT List
Fundamental Operations
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

### ADT Stack
- LIFO (Last In, First Out)

Fundamental Operations
- Push (add an element to the top of the stack)
- Pop (removes and returns the top element from the stack)
- Peek/Top (returns the value of the top element)

More operations:
- IsEmpty (checks if stack is empty)
- Size (returns the number of elements)

### ADT Queue
- FIFO (First In, First Out)

Fundamental Operations
- Enqueue (add an element to the rear/end of the queue)
- Dequeue (remove an element from the front of the queue)
- Peek/Front (retrieve the value of the element at the front)

More operations:
- IsEmpty
-IsFull
